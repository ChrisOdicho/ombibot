## How to use:

Command Structure:

```
[trigger] [command] [expression]
```

- `trigger` - one of "plex" or "ombibot" or "ombi"
- `command` - one of "m" or "mov" or "movie" or "t" or "tv" or "show" or "series"
- `expression` - the movie or show you're searching for

You can also send DMs to the bot, for your more embarassing requests. The DMs don't require the trigger word.

## Built With:
